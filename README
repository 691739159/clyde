The Clyde library
-----------------

The Clyde library provides various facilities for creating action-oriented
networked 3D games. Its packages include:

  * config - configuration management and tools for config manipulation
  * delta - adds support for delta encoding objects on top of Narya streaming
  * editor - annotation-controlled reflective object editing
  * export - version-resilient serialization to XML and binary data formats
  * expr - expression evaluation and symbol binding
  * math - basic 2D and 3D math classes
  * openal - ties Nenya's OpenAL support into OpenGL scene handling
  * opengl - base classes for canvas and Display-based OpenGL applications
  * opengl.camera - camera representation and handling
  * opengl.compositor - view sorting and compositing, render effects
  * opengl.effect - particle systems and related effects, particle editor tool
  * opengl.geometry - static and dynamic geometry classes, software skinning
  * opengl.gui - graphical user interface (derived from JME-BUI)
  * opengl.material - support for complex materials, projections
  * opengl.model - static and articulated models, explicit and procedural animation
  * opengl.renderer - core renderer and states, wrappers for OpenGL objects
  * opengl.scene - scene representation, scene influences and viewer effects
  * probs - probabilistic data types
  * tudey - engine for environments with 2D server logic and 3D graphical representation
  * tudey.shape - general 2D shape representation and computation
  * tudey.space - 2D space representation
  * tudey.tools - scene editor
  * util - various utility classes, reflective deep copying/comparison/hashing

Documentation is somewhat sparse at the moment, but inspection of the code in
the tests/ directory shows examples of use of many features of the library.

Building
--------

Building the library is very simple. First ensure that the necessary third
party jar files are available in the lib/ directory. See lib/README for a list
of the necessary third party jar files and how to get them.

The library is built using Ant, a modern build tool written in and for Java. If
you aren't already using Ant for other projects, it can be found here:

  http://ant.apache.org/

Invoke ant with any of the following targets:

  all: builds the distribution files and javadoc documentation
  compile: builds only the class files (dist/classes)
  javadoc: builds only the javadoc documentation (dist/docs)
  dist: builds the distribution jar files (dist/*.jar)

Distribution
------------

The Clyde library is released under the BSD license. The most recent version of
the library is available here:

  http://code.google.com/p/clyde/

Contribution
------------

Contributions to Clyde are welcome. Read-only access to the subversion
repository is available at:

http://clyde.googlecode.com/svn/trunk

Patches can be mailed to Andrzej Kapolka <andrzej@threerings.net>.
